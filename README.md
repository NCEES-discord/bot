# bot
The NCEES discord bot

Our entry point: ``index.js``, set your debuggers to start here. I've included a launch json with this already 

To get this project running:

do ``npm update`` after cloning, to download dependancies.
create ``auth.json`` in root containing ``{"token":<YOUR API KEY HERE>}`` if you wish to test via your own bot.

It is expected that you at least do your own unit testing (don't need to set up your own discord bot for that), and more comprehensive testing will be done via the "NCEES-dev" bot after your code has been merged to the dev branch.
